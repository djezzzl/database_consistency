The main goal of the project is to provide an easy way to check the consistency of the
database constraints with the application validations.

Currently, we can:
- find missing null constraints ([ColumnPresenceChecker](#columnpresencechecker))
- find missing length validations ([LengthConstraintChecker](#lengthconstraintchecker))
- find missing presence validations ([NullConstraintChecker](#nullconstraintchecker))
- find missing uniqueness validations ([UniqueIndexChecker](#uniqueindexchecker))
- find missing foreign keys for `BelongsTo` associations ([ForeignKeyChecker](#foreignkeychecker))
- find missing unique indexes for uniqueness validation ([MissingUniqueIndexChecker](#missinguniqueindexchecker))
- find missing index for `HasOne` and `HasMany` associations ([MissingIndexChecker](#missingindexchecker))
- find primary keys with integer/serial type ([PrimaryKeyTypeChecker](#primarykeytypechecker))
- find mismatching primary key types with their foreign keys ([ForeignKeyTypeChecker](#foreignkeytypechecker))
- find redundant non-unique indexes ([RedundantIndexChecker](#redundantindexchecker))
- find redundant uniqueness constraint ([RedundantUniqueIndexChecker](#redundantuniqueindexchecker))

We also provide flexible configuration ([example](rails-example/.database_consistency.yml)) and [integrations](#integrations).

We support the following databases: `SQLite3`, `PostgreSQL` and `MySQL`.
We support any framework or pure ruby which uses [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord).

Check out our [FAQ](FAQ.md) section.

**Check out** the [database_validations](https://github.com/toptal/database_validations) to have faster and reliable
uniqueness validations and `BelongsTo` associations using [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'database_consistency', group: :development, require: false
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

If you are using ActiveStorage and/or ActionText, run the installer to prevent false positives caused by these libraries.

```bash
bundle exec database_consistency install
```

## Usage

In the root directory of your Rails project just run `bundle exec database_consistency`.

### Non Rails projects

For any other framework or pure ruby, you can copy the following code and create a file `database_consistency_runner.rb`.

```ruby
# First of all, you need to load all models
# The following example is for Rails, but it can be anything
require_relative 'config/environment'
Rails.application.eager_load!

# Now start the check
require 'database_consistency'
result = DatabaseConsistency.run
exit result
```

Now, just start the script: `bundle exec ruby database_consistency_runner`.

## Configuration

You can configure the gem to skip some of its checks using [.database_consistency.yml](rails-example/.database_consistency.yml) file.
By default, every checker is enabled.

There is also a way to pass settings through environment variables
(they will have priority over settings from [.database_consistency.yml](rails-example/.database_consistency.yml) file).
You can pass `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and/or `COLOR=1`.

### Multiple configuration files

It's common scenario to have few configuration files - e.g. one is convenient setup and other is list of temporarily disabled checks that are subject to fix (TODOs). You can run the check with multiple configuration files by passing them in `-c path_to_config` or `--config=path_to_config` using built in `database_consistency` script:
```ruby
bundle exec database_consistency -c db_consistency_todo.yml -c db_consistency_another_todo.yml
```
Default `.database_consistency.yml` config is always used and included first in this case.

Or in your custom script:
```ruby
require 'database_consistency'
# Notice that here you need to explicitely pass '.database_consistency.yml' if you want it to be used along with others
result = DatabaseConsistency.run(['.database_consistency.yml', 'db_consistency_todo.yml', 'db_consistency_another_todo.yml'])
exit result

# If you need only '.database_consistency.yml' you don't have to explicitely pass it
DatabaseConsistency.run # same as `DatabaseConsistency.run('.database_consistency.yml')
```

The order of files is important - latest given has the highest priority. That means if we have these config files:
```yaml
User:
  email:
    ColumnPresenceChecker:
      enabled: false
```
```yaml
User:
  code:
    NullConstraintChecker:
      enabled: false
    MissingIndexChecker:
      enabled: false
```
```yaml
User:
  code:
    NullConstraintChecker:
      enabled: true
```
Applying them in given order is the same as having this one config file:
```yaml
User:
  email:
    ColumnPresenceChecker:
      enabled: false
  code:
    NullConstraintChecker:
      enabled: true
    MissingIndexChecker:
      enabled: false
```

### TODO generation

You can generate TODO file with the following command: `bundle exec database_consistency -g`. 
It works fine with passed/existing configurations and will generate the configuration only for failing. 

## How it works?

### ColumnPresenceChecker

Imagine your model has a `validates :email, presence: true` validation on some field or a required `belongs_to :user` association but doesn't have a not-null constraint in
the database. In that case, your model's definition assumes (in most cases) you won't have `null` values in the database but
it's possible to skip validations or directly write improper data in the table.
Keep in mind that `belongs_to` is required by default starting from Rails 5 given `config.load_defaults` is in place and unless `config.active_record.belongs_to_required_by_default` is explicitly set to `false`.

To avoid the inconsistency and be always sure your value won't be `null` you should add not-null constraint.

| allow_nil/allow_blank/if/unless | database | status |
| :-----------------------------: | :------: | :----: |
| at least one provided           | required | fail   |
| at least one provided           | optional | ok     |
| all missing                     | required | ok     |
| all missing                     | optional | fail   |

### LengthConstraintChecker

Imagine your model has limit constraint on some field in the database but doesn't have
`validates :email, length: { maximum: <VALUE> }` validation. In that case, you're sure that you won't have values with exceeded length in the database.
But each attempt to save a value with exceeded length on that field will be rolled back with error raised and without `errors` on your object.
Mostly, you'd like to catch it properly and for that length validator exists.

We fail if any of following conditions are satisfied:
- there is no length validation for the column
- there is length validation for the column but with greater limit than in database, so some values will still throw an error

### NullConstraintChecker

Imagine your model has not-null constraint on some field in the database but doesn't have
`validates :email, presence: true` validation. In that case, you're sure that you won't have `null` values in the database.
But each attempt to save the `nil` value on that field will be rolled back with error raised and without `errors` on your object.
Mostly, you'd like to catch it properly and for that presence validator exists.

We fail if the column satisfies the following conditions:
- column is required in the database
- column is not a primary key (we don't need need presence validators for primary keys)
- model records timestamps and column's name is not `created_at` or `updated_at`
- column is not used for any Presence or Inclusion validators
- column is not used for any Exclusion validators with `nil`
- column is not used for any Numericality validators with `allow_nil` disabled
- column is not used for required BelongsTo association
- column has not a default value
- column has not a default function

### UniqueIndexChecker

Imagine your model has a unique index in the database but doesn't have
`validates :email, uniqueness: true` validation. In that case, you're sure that you won't have duplicated values in the database.
But each attempt to save a duplicated value on that field will be rolled back with error raised and without `errors` on your object.
Mostly, you'd like to catch it properly and for that uniqueness validator exists.
This checker also support unique index on multiple columns (which should have a `validates :email, uniqueness: { scope: :last_name }` validation).

We fail if any of following conditions are satisfied:
- there is no uniqueness validation for the column(s)

### ForeignKeyChecker

Imagine your model has `belongs_to :user`. It can happen that the user, it's being belonging to, may not be existing anymore in the database.
This could bring bugs and in order to ensure the data consistency, you need to have foreign key constraint in the database.

We fail if the following conditions are satisfied:
- belongs_to association is not polymorphic
- there is no foreign key constraint

### MissingUniqueIndexChecker

Imagine your model has a `validates :email, uniqueness: true` validation but has no unique index in the database. As general
problem your validation can be skipped or there is possible duplicates insert because of race condition. To keep your data
consistent you should cover your validation with proper unique index in the database (if possible). It will ensure you don't
have duplicates.

We fail if the following conditions are satisfied:
- there is no unique index for the uniqueness validation

### MissingIndexChecker

Imagine your model has a `has_one :user` association but has no index in the database. In this case querying the database
to get the associated instance can be very inefficient. Mostly, you'll need an index to process such queries fast.

Additionally, `has_one` associations should be unique on the database level to avoid unexpected behaviour.

We fail if the following conditions are satisfied:
- there is no index for the `HasOne` or `HasMany` association
- it has a `through` option

### PrimaryKeyTypeChecker

ActiveRecord has changed its default types for primary keys ([PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26266/files)).
Given no one is immune to [problems short types may create](https://m.signalvnoise.com/update-on-basecamp-3-being-stuck-in-read-only-as-of-nov-8-922am-cst/), we
added a checker to identify those IDs.

We fail if the following conditions are satisfied:
- primary key type is not in the list: bigint, bigserial, uuid.

### ForeignKeyTypeChecker

It's dangerous to have foreign key type to be smaller than paired primary key type.
Given no one is immune to [possible problems](https://m.signalvnoise.com/update-on-basecamp-3-being-stuck-in-read-only-as-of-nov-8-922am-cst/),
we added a checker to identify those mismatches.

We fail if the following conditions are satisfied:
- foreign key type is less than a paired primary key.

### RedundantIndexChecker

This checker helps to identify redundant non-unique indexes. Assuming you have an index in the database
that covers column A and another index that covers columns A and B (order is important). In this case,
the first index may be removed as it is covered by second one.

We fail if the following conditions are satisfied:
- there is an index that has prefix that consists the current one.

### RedundantUniqueIndexChecker

This checker helps to identify redundant uniqueness on some indexes. Assuming you have an unique index in the database
that covers columns A and B (order is not important) and another unique index that covers column A only. In this case,
the first unique constraint is redundant as it is covered by the second one.

We fail if the following conditions are satisfied:
- there is an unique index that consists only from columns for the current one.

## Example

```
$ bundle exec database_consistency
NullConstraintChecker fail User code column is required in the database but do not have presence validator
NullConstraintChecker fail User company_id column is required in the database but do not have presence validator for association (company)
LengthConstraintChecker fail Company note column has limit in the database but do not have length validator
MissingUniqueIndexChecker fail User name+email model should have proper unique index in the database
ForeignKeyChecker fail User company should have foreign key in the database
ForeignKeyTypeChecker fail User company associated model key (id) with type (integer) mismatches key (company_id) with type (integer(8))
MissingIndexChecker fail Company user associated model should have proper index in the database
ForeignKeyTypeChecker fail Company user associated model key (company_id) with type (integer(8)) mismatches key (id) with type (integer)
MissingIndexChecker fail Country users associated model should have proper index in the database
ColumnPresenceChecker fail User phone column should be required in the database
ColumnPresenceChecker fail User name column is required but there is possible null value insert
UniqueIndexChecker fail User index_users_on_name_and_slug index is unique in the database but do not have uniqueness validator
RedundantUniqueIndexChecker fail User index_users_on_name_and_slug index uniqueness is redundant as (index_users_on_slug) covers it
RedundantIndexChecker fail User index_users_on_phone index is redundant as (index_users_on_phone_and_slug) covers it
ColumnPresenceChecker fail User tmp column (tmp) is missing in table (users) but used for presence validation
ForeignKeyTypeChecker fail User something association (something) of class (User) relies on field (something_id) of table (users) but it is missing
```

See [rails-example](rails-example) project for more details.

## Integrations

Configuration example for [overcommit](https://github.com/brigade/overcommit) gem.

```yaml
PreCommit:
  DatabaseConsistency:
    enabled: true
    quiet: false
    command: ['bundle', 'exec', 'database_consistency']
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
You need to have installed and running `postgresql` and `mysql`.
And for each adapter manually create a database called `database_consistency_test` accessible by your local user.

#### MySQL

```
# user is your local user from $whoami command
mysql -uroot --password
mysql> CREATE DATABASE database_consistency_test;
mysql> CREATE USER user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_consistency_test.* TO user@localhost;
```

#### PostgreSQL

```
psql postgres
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE database_consistency_test;
```

Then, run `DATABASE=<adapter name> bundle exec rspec` to run the tests for the specified database.
Available options are:
- `mysql`
- `postgresql`
- `sqlite`

Default is `sqlite`. 

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version,
update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git
tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
